Tf2 Ui with a little bit of spice.

How to install: put the aspect ratio folder that is the same as your ingame ratio into your C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\ 

Crosshairs: Fog's crosshairs (v3) are installed, however they are not centered in order to do so go into the hudlayout.res file and change the xpos and ypos to your liking.

Currently optimized for 16x9 16x10 and 4x3
